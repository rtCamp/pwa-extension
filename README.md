_The latest [PWA plugin 0.6.0](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/) now has offline caching for theme assets, uploaded images, navigations and manifest for app icon as well, so this extension is no longer needed._

**Author:** [rtCamp](https://github.com/rtCamp/)

**Tags:** [pwa](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/pwa)
**Requires at least:** 4.9
**Tested up to:** 5.7.1
**License:** [GPLv2 or later](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html)
**Requires PHP:** 5.4+

## Requirements
- The Official [PWA](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/) Plugin.
- Generate the PWA Icons and put the icons in theme's `/assets/img/` directory. _You can use [this site](https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/) to generate icons._ (Example path for 512x512 size will be <your-theme>/assets/img/icon-512x512.png)
  
## Features

- `Add to Home Screen` popup for mobiles with custom icon setup in WP theme `(your-theme/assets/img/icon-{width}x{height}.png)`.
- Offline reading by caching assets and pages.

### Offline Form Submission.
- Submit gravity form even if you are offline. The plugin will send form response once you get back online.
- The offline form submission will only work for the routes added to the plugin settings page.
- If no routes are set the offline form submission script will not be enqueued.
e.g Enable offline form submission with following settings for the forms available on routes `example.com/contact` and `example.com/feedback`
```
/contact
/feedback
```

## Steps to setup add to home screen for your site.

- Add app icon images of all sizes in your WordPress theme assets folder with <your-theme>`/assets/img/icon-{width}x{height}.png` path
- The valid size of the images can be 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512.
- Example image file name `icon-192x192.png`.
- The path of the icons can be changed with `rt_pwa_extensions_app_icon_{height}_{width}` filter
- Example snippet to change icon src.

```php
add_filter( 'rt_pwa_extensions_app_icon_72_72', 'update_icon_src' );
/**
 * Updates icon src.
 *
 * @return string
 */
function update_icon_src() {
	return 'www.example.com/new-image.png';
}
```

## Integration with izooto plugin.

- The [iZooto](https://wordpress.org/plugins/izooto-web-push/) plugin must be installed and activated to use the izooto notification services.
- Registers izooto service worker using `wp_front_service_worker` hook to main service worker file
- Removes Service worker code of izooto from `?izooto=sw` to prevent conflicting it with main service worker.
